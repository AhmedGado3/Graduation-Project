            <h1>Result of CT scan analysis of the chest</h1>

            <p>The result of a CT scan of the chest shows that the lungs are healthy and free of any signs of cancer.
                There are no suspicious masses or nodules in the lung, and the respiratory system is functioning
                normally. This result is a positive indicator of lung health and that there are no serious problems that
                require concern at the present time. It is recommended to continue regular follow-up and preventive
                examinations to ensure lung health is maintained.</p>

        <p>The result of a chest X-ray indicates that the lungs are in healthy condition and there are no signs of
            cancer. The lung tissue and bronchi appear normal, and there are no abnormal masses or enlarged lymph
            nodes. This result confirms that there are no serious lung problems at the present time.</p>

        <h1>Pulmonary function test result (PFT)</h1>

        <p>The results of the lung function analysis indicate that respiratory capabilities and lung functions are
            at a normal level. Airflow indicators, lung capacity, and oxygen-to-carbon dioxide ratio are all within
            normal ranges, indicating that the lungs are functioning well. This result reflects excellent lung
            health and the absence of any respiratory disorders.</p>
